Unicorn Companies Data Visualization and Analysis
-This project is aimed at analyzing and visualizing data of unicorn companies, which are private startups with a valuation of over $1 billion. The data is obtained from various sources, including Crunchbase, and includes information such as company name, valuation, funding, and industry.

Steps Taken Data Collection: The was provided for me by Quantum Analytics Ng for my first Python course project.

Data Cleaning: The next step was to clean the data by removing duplicates, filling in missing values, and transforming the data into a format for easy analysis.

Data Analysis: After cleaning the data, I performed various analyses to gain insights into the unicorn companies. I calculated the return on investment (ROI) for each company, sorted the companies by ROI, and identified the top 10 unicorn companies with the biggest ROI.

Data Visualization: Finally, I created visualizations to help communicate the insights gained from the data analysis. I created bar charts of the top 10 unicorn companies with their funding values and ROI values.

Challenges Faced One of the main challenges faced in this project was dealing with missing data. Some of the datasets I collected had missing values, which had to be dealt with before performing any analysis. Another challenge was ensuring that the data was in a format that could be easily analyzed and visualized. This required some data transformation and cleaning.

Overall, this project was successful in analyzing and visualizing data of unicorn companies. The insights gained from this analysis can help investors make informed decisions about investing in these companies.
